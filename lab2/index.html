			<h1>Hello World!</h1>

		<p>Hi, I'm Vanessa! I'm a 4th year Art major. I like reading manga, drawing, and baking in my free time. I don't have much experience with coding and I find it to be quite difficult, so I hope I'll be able to do well in this class. So far, html doesn't seem to be too hard to understand, so I hope I will be able to keep up for the rest of the quarter.</p>
