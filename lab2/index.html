			<h1>Hello World!</h1>

		<p>Hi, I'm Vanessa! I'm a 4th year Art major. I like reading manga, drawing, and baking in my free time. I like playing video games as well, but I haven't been doing that much recently. I don't have much experience with coding and I find it to be quite difficult, so I hope I'll be able to do well in this class. So far, html doesn't seem to be too hard to understand, so I hope I will be able to keep up for the rest of the quarter.</p>

		<p>Hey all! I am Nick Eyestone, a 3rd year college student and art major. I enjoy reading comics, drawing, gaming, 3d printing props, costume making, and I am very adventurous when it comes to the outdoors. I was on my high school robotics team for 3 years and used to be a computer science major, so I have a basic understanding of coding. I hope to learn more about html and web related code to set up a proper portfolio site!</p>
