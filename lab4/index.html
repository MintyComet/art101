	<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>

	<div id="main-content">
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>List of Assigned Tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task.</li>
				<li>Task 2: Pseudocode a computer task.</li>
				<li>Task 3: Turn pseudocode into comments.</li>
				<li>Task 4: Create an index.html for Lab 4.</li>
			</ol>


		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Pseudocode an Everyday Task:</p>
			<p>How to Make a Japanese Cake Roll:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Preheat an oven to 350°F/ 176°C and prepare a 9x13 in. baking tray lined with parchment paper.</li>
					<li>In a bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, salt, vanilla, oil, and milk together.</li>
					<li>Using a sieve, sift cake flour and baking powder into the egg yolk mixture then whisk together.</li>
					<li>In a large mixing bowl, wipe the bowl with some lemon juice or vinegar using a paper towel. Add the egg whites and beat with an electric mixer on high until frothy.</li>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Add cream of tartar and beat until whites are opaque and the bubbles have tightened up.</li>
							<li>Add sugar and beat until the egg whites hold stiff peaks when you lift the mixer out of the bowl.</li>
						</ol>
					<li>Use a rubber spatula to add ⅓ of the egg white meringue into the egg yolk mixture and gently fold until it’s mostly mixed. Repeat for the remaining thirds.</li>
					<li>Pour the batter into the baking tray and tap the tray a few times on a counter to release any air bubbles.</li>
					<li>Bake for 15-17 min or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
					<li>After taking the cake out of the oven, quickly flip it over onto a slightly damp kitchen towel or another piece of parchment paper that is larger than the cake.</li>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Peel off the parchment paper and roll the cake slowly starting from the short side of the cake. Allow cake to cool completely while it’s rolled up.</li>
						</ol>
					<li>To make the whipped cream, use an electric mixer with the whisk attachment to mix together heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until medium to stiff peaks form.</li>
					<li>After the cake has cooled, unroll and trim the edges.</li>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Spread whipped cream and add fruits or anything else on top if desired.</li>
						<li>Gently roll cake back up without the towel/paper.</li>
						<li>Wrap the cake with plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge for 1 hour. It can be served after this.</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>

			<p>Pseudocode a Computer Task:</p>
			<p>Searching for a book on a library website:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Prompt user to input whether they are searching by title or author.
						<ol type = "a">
							<li>Display a drop down select box.
							<li>Display text telling the user to select from the two options.
						</ol>
					<li>Prompt user to type in their search text.
						<ol type = "a">
							<li>Display a text box for input.
							<li>Display text telling the user to type their search.
						</ol>
					<li>Accept user input.
						<ol type = "a">
							<li>Read the option selected from the drop down menu.
							<li>Read the text inputted by the user in the text box.
						</ol>
					<li>Compare the input text to the library lists of the type selected.
						<ol type = "a">
							<li>Evaluate whether the user chose author or title.
							<li>Check if any text in the library’s data matches the text inputted by the user.
							<li>Check if any information partially matches the user input.
						</ol>
					<li>Sort resulting information for display.
						<ol type = "a">
							<li>Organize information results from closest matches to partial matches.
							<li>Sort data into a vertically listed format.
						</ol>
					<li>Display information or that it is not found.
						<ol type = "a">
							<li>If there was one or more exact matches for the search, display the organized list.
							<li>If there was no exact match, display a message saying so and also the partially matching results.
						</ol>
				</ol>

			<p>Turn Pseudocode into Comments:</p>
				<pre><code>
